"Delivery was delayed a little bit, it was worth the wait.

This camera have top of the line features and great build quality.
With battery and 15-135mm lens, it weighs around or above 1kg.
Feels premium in hand.

If you are on budget and looking for same specs camera in canon go for M6 mark ii, which have almost everything equal to EOS90D.",5
Working fine but one thing I want to mention is that the 16GB card that comes with it cannot record in 4k. So better buy yourself a good high capacity SD Card.,5
Amazing camera. Lot of beautiful options to consider for a photo.,5

"I have got best results on ordinary lens that's big improvement in auto focus and overall performance.
Battery drain little faster than A7III.
As a long time Sony user I found A7IV more user-friendly than previous models. Buttons touch feel good and comfortable grip on body.
Faster processing power, rotating screen, Increased megapixels, better colour tone, improved video and autofocus system is worth for upgrading.
With body I got faster 64GB memory card, camera bag and external charger.",

"Happy to be the first person to review this product. A camera with A7M3 features and a body like A6600. Smallest and lightest full frame beast from Sony.
So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",

It incorporate such advance camera technologies that beats bigger dslrs easily. Especially the eye auto focus is blazingly fast. At this price it beats even double priced DSLR of other brands. Pictures are razor sharp with nice pleasing color. Very easy to carry as small lightweight. Excellent buy in sale. IF you are planning ...

Picture quality is very good.. upgraded from nikon 3100. Auto focus is fast.. easy to use...

"Camera is very good. Although EVF & Kit lens aren't that great but yeah manageable to deal with! Rest is best! Eye auto focus is remarkable.
I used sony 50mm F1.8 lens with it. The results are great. Buy a gimbal or mini-tripod for awesome vlogging. Shoots good videos",

Mind Blowing ?? I bought a camera for the first time in my life,5
best thanks Flipkart,
"received 7M3K today with best price of the year, it includes free Sony bag, charger and UHS2 64gb SD card.
this is most hyped camera and best in the class considering its price.
some clicked photos clicked on auto mode with kit lens .",
One of the best camera in today's world. Top class low light performance and the eye tracking is the best features in this camera out of all its features. Flipkart delivery is real quick and the packaging is top class. I would suggest to go for this camera i you are looking yourself as a professional photograher. A worth investment.,

"Serves the purpose of taking a click for the moment. Can be used for both normal and selfie pics. Generates your printed pic instantly which are of decent quality given its price.
Few cons :
not good for taking pics in bright sunlight, develops a faded pic
Can't take pic from a distance, it wont capture the subject properly
The width it covers while taking selfie is just enough for 2 people",

"Its value for money for enthusiast level photographers, photos are crisp and sharp! Focus is good may not be the best, colours are accurate and do justice.. The biggest downside is the battery, when coming from normal SLR the battery is only half efficient. Taking videos drains more battery so its always necessary to have a spare battery...Autofocus may be improved in future by firmware updates",
The images are crisp. It is easy to learn for beginners like me. The autofocus is very good. And it has the best grip among all mirrorless cameras.,
"great camera ..... considering the price , it offers complete set features . I would rather say it gives you all the features of sony and canon camera combined in one camera . The body is sturdy ,grip is nice , menu is easy to navigate.It is my first camera and I got this as a gift from my wife on our anniversary. I just love this camera. This camera is like mini z6/z7 with a dx format sensor and anyone looking for a mirrorless or dslr at this price must go for this camera.",

The gyro stabilization 1080p-60fps is good and helps a lot.
If you are a beginner and not having a lot of money to invest in a GOPRO then this is the best buy. It will help you out get familiar and creat wonderful vlogs and videos.
Do purchase extra batteries and extra mounts If necessary but since they already provide a lot of accessories I don't think you would be needing anymore.

"Flipkart is not having space for Pictures. I shoot with many still pics and Video on Cruise, Land and Under water in Maldives.I am impressed with it. No need for too much editing. From my experience i am sure its Panasonic sensor because color rendition is typical Panasonic. Videos will blown away my mind, smooth and fluid. I dont care about 2K or 4K. Its a terrific action camera for my purpose.",
"Very good camera, has nice controls both touch and buttons.
Focus can be a issue sometimes,
Very good start support from the box with all the mounts and screws and everything, waterproof case is in the box no need to purchase seperately.
Buy some additional accesories such as bag and gorilla mount and chest head straps and good to go!
Stills are good as well.",5

- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

"Serves the purpose of taking a click for the moment. Can be used for both normal and selfie pics. Generates your printed pic instantly which are of decent quality given its price.
Few cons :
not good for taking pics in bright sunlight, develops a faded pic
Can't take pic from a distance, it wont capture the subject properly
The width it covers while taking selfie is just enough for 2 people",

this is most hyped camera and best in the class considering its price.
some clicked photos clicked on auto mode with kit lens .",
One of the best camera in today's world. Top class low light performance and the eye tracking is the best features in this camera out of all its features. Flipkart delivery is real quick and the packaging is top class. I would suggest to go for this camera i you are looking yourself as a professional photograher. A worth investment.,

Very useful?,
"This is a must have accessory kit if you are using osmo pocket 1. There are 3 units, 1- Gimbal, 2- Bluetooth kit which comes very handy for taking hyperlapse shot without any shake, 3- the tripod mount kit,
Cons- the screw for the tripod mount is not provided and need to be purchased separately, also in this expansion kit there is no underwater housing kit which is also separately. Overall it is suitable for my traveling purpose",
Just a missing puzzle with Osmo pocket. Much needed. Strongly recommended.,

It over heats and often turns off whenever I use it as webcam,
Overall camera is good.but heating issue too.battery draining fastly..even in 4k 60fps you can't record video for atleast 15 min .before that it should automatically shut down because of heating issue.don't go for it.dji osmo 2 is better than gopro 10 ..just waste of money.,
Nice I am happy,

"Happy to be the first person to review this product. A camera with A7M3 features and a body like A6600. Smallest and lightest full frame beast from Sony.
So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",

So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",

- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",5

I am an amateur photographer and have mostly clicked photos in auto mode during last 4 months.
Pictures and videos both are great being a mirrorless camera, but it seems the cost of lenses are high for fujifilm.
I am searching for good lens adaptor so that I can use Canon or Nikon lenses from friends.
Its a must buy for bloggers and hobby photographers who hates heavy weight traditional DSLR.

"The fujifilm xa7 is the best camera in its price point, compared to its competitors, i.e Canon 200d mk2, canon m50, sony a6000, nikon d5600. xa7 is the best among these, other cameras in this price point offers 4k, but its cropped 4k. XA7 captures 6k videos and downscales it to 4k, its lightweight and compact. visual quality is awesome and has nice depth of field (background blur). one thing i dont like is the build quality of the lens, while taking camera in hand, the body is nice and sturdy...

I like the white color. It merges perfectly with the painting that I chose to hide the camera. The picture is clear. Sound recording was good. I am able to access the video directly on my mobile phone after attaching the camera to my wifi. The camera size is quite small. Very useful product. Happy with the purchase overall.,

"Happy to be the first person to review this product. A camera with A7M3 features and a body like A6600. Smallest and lightest full frame beast from Sony.
So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",

So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",5

Looks wise 10/10
Weight- very lite
And also looks very small compared to other nikon z models
If you want to go with best looks and feel that vintage feel go with nikon zfc
Or just want purpose of taking photos go
With z50 has also same sensors and costs 15k lesser than this zfc
I’m fully satisfied , you also get a wildcraft bag a 64gb sd and extra battery??",

Perfect Gift for my teenager..simply loved it. The beauty of hard instant copy of pics and the memories associated with it are priceless. Good buy,
"Serves the purpose of taking a click for the moment. Can be used for both normal and selfie pics. Generates your printed pic instantly which are of decent quality given its price.
Few cons :
not good for taking pics in bright sunlight, develops a faded pic
Can't take pic from a distance, it wont capture the subject properly
The width it covers while taking selfie is just enough for 2 people",

"Its value for money for enthusiast level photographers, photos are crisp and sharp! Focus is good may not be the best, colours are accurate and do justice.. The biggest downside is the battery, when coming from normal SLR the battery is only half efficient. Taking videos drains more battery so its always necessary to have a spare battery...Autofocus may be improved in future by firmware updates",
The images are crisp. It is easy to learn for beginners like me. The autofocus is very good. And it has the best grip among all mirrorless cameras.,
"great camera ..... considering the price , it offers complete set features . I would rather say it gives you all the features of sony and canon camera combined in one camera . The body is sturdy ,grip is nice , menu is easy to navigate.It is my first camera and I got this as a gift from my wife on our anniversary. I just love this camera. This camera is like mini z6/z7 with a dx format sensor and anyone looking for a mirrorless or dslr at this price must go for this camera.",

If you are a beginner and not having a lot of money to invest in a GOPRO then this is the best buy. It will help you out get familiar and creat wonderful vlogs and videos.
Do purchase extra batteries and extra mounts If necessary but since they already provide a lot of accessories I don't think you would be needing anymore.

"Flipkart is not having space for Pictures. I shoot with many still pics and Video on Cruise, Land and Under water in Maldives.I am impressed with it. No need for too much editing. From my experience i am sure its Panasonic sensor because color rendition is typical Panasonic. Videos will blown away my mind, smooth and fluid. I dont care about 2K or 4K. Its a terrific action camera for my purpose.",
"Very good camera, has nice controls both touch and buttons.
Focus can be a issue sometimes,
Very good start support from the box with all the mounts and screws and everything, waterproof case is in the box no need to purchase seperately.
Buy some additional accesories such as bag and gorilla mount and chest head straps and good to go!
Stills are good as well.",5

"Serves the purpose of taking a click for the moment. Can be used for both normal and selfie pics. Generates your printed pic instantly which are of decent quality given its price.
Few cons :
not good for taking pics in bright sunlight, develops a faded pic
Can't take pic from a distance, it wont capture the subject properly
The width it covers while taking selfie is just enough for 2 people",

Faster processing power, rotating screen, Increased megapixels, better colour tone, improved video and autofocus system is worth for upgrading.

"Happy to be the first person to review this product. A camera with A7M3 features and a body like A6600. Smallest and lightest full frame beast from Sony.
So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",5

"Happy to be the first person to review this product. A camera with A7M3 features and a body like A6600. Smallest and lightest full frame beast from Sony.
So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",

Update(24/4/20):- The camera has started lagging since one month, and is associated with audio-visual delay.

It incorporate such advance camera technologies that beats bigger dslrs easily. Especially the eye auto focus is blazingly fast. At this price it beats even double priced DSLR of other brands. Pictures are razor sharp with nice pleasing color. Very easy to carry as small lightweight. Excellent buy in sale. IF you are planning ...

"The fujifilm xa7 is the best camera in its price point, compared to its competitors, i.e Canon 200d mk2, canon m50, sony a6000, nikon d5600. xa7 is the best among these, other cameras in this price point offers 4k, but its cropped 4k. XA7 captures 6k videos and downscales it to 4k, its lightweight and compact. visual quality is awesome and has nice depth of field (background blur). one thing i dont like is the build quality of the lens, while taking camera in hand, the body is nice and sturdy...

I like the white color. It merges perfectly with the painting that I chose to hide the camera. The picture is clear. Sound recording was good. I am able to access the video directly on my mobile phone after attaching the camera to my wifi. The camera size is quite small. Very useful product. Happy with the purchase overall.,

So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",

Looks wise 10/10
Weight- very lite
And also looks very small compared to other nikon z models
If you want to go with best looks and feel that vintage feel go with nikon zfc
Or just want purpose of taking photos go
With z50 has also same sensors and costs 15k lesser than this zfc
I’m fully satisfied , you also get a wildcraft bag a 64gb sd and extra battery??",
"Happy to be the first person to review this product. A camera with A7M3 features and a body like A6600. Smallest and lightest full frame beast from Sony.
So what contains in the flipkart bundle box:
- Camera box with 28-60mm lens and a 64 GB memory card.
- A Sony branded bag. (NOT a backpack)
- A Sony BC-QZI charger.

I think the kit is worth a buy in all ways. If you are a professional photographer you can think of 1.8 or 2.8 aperture lenses later on.",

Sound quality is superb, very rich and with a perfect combination of sounds, no latency issues and the super latency mode(game mode) is really very good for gamers.
Design and built quality feels good and premium. Looks are really very nice. Comfortable in ear.

Pros:-
1) Good noise cancellation , it does have a snug fit to the ear so it stays in place(need to put ear-tips that fit your ear).

I bought this for vero competitive price..
The earbuds are very good with base but due to good base lacks some treble but overall it sounds very good.
The design of earbuds are very comfortable and fits in perfectly. These are not normal bulging TWS..but looks very good on ears (premium).
Other than that addition of type c makes it more convenient to use.

"Realme buds 2 Neo review by SmartphoneWorldTamil
Build - Not so good, no braided cable, no silver plated jack. Fits nicely in ear but sometimes I feel uncomfortableness if I use for more than 3h continously.
Sound quality - Good bass but vocals could be slightly better
Mic Quality is decent. Clear voice pickup.
Overall I would say spend extra Rs.100 and go for realme buds 2.",5

Sound quality is superb, very rich and with a perfect combination of sounds, no latency issues and the super latency mode(game mode) is really very good for gamers.
Design and built quality feels good and premium. Looks are really very nice. Comfortable in ear.
These don't make vaccum in ear like other TWS's and neckbands.

Latency is negligible and the microphone is also fine. The control buttons come handy for various controls. The best thing is, it only takes an hour for charging but lasts for more than 20 hours. The fit of the neckband is just perfect. Also they provided extra ear pieces. Overall a great purchase in such a good price range.",

I am not a music head so wont be able to comment on how the bass and treble is however for any average person the device drivers do deliver a pretty solid loud sound with clear clarity. I raised the volume to only 70% because more than that it was too much loud for me. Build quality considering price point is good.

"Best AI Gaming earbuds are really good and loaded with features, it supports touch control, play/pause, music mode, gaming mode, noise cancellation to provide best call quality and many others. Playback time of more than 48 hours once the case is charged fully. It also pauses the music when removed from the ear, and starts playing it when plugged back into the ear, this in-ear detection mode is really awesome and handy.",
"Really cool earbuds with good sound quality. I really enjoyed using them, specially their touch sensor are really good. Very easy and comfortable to use. One of the best products in this range. The added perk is the case with glowing lights.",
"Firstly, spidy with lightning design is just good. Black color is obsession??. Case design is great and can be open one . Buds are very light in weight buds are really comfortable and fits well in ears ??. As usual battery life is well known for truke and it's best part of brand at 80% charging of buds I played music for 7 hrs.",

"Angled jack would have been better. Audio quality is good. Mic is working fine. I bought these as to attend long meeting sessions as i don't feel comfortable with the model having silicone buds.

If you are okay with silicone buds then go for Bassheadset 103. Its audio quality is better than Basshead 104. I also have 103 model with me.

Do not expect lot of bass in these two models, bass effect is very little. If you are not a bass lover, model 103 would suit you well.",

I bought this for vero competitive price..
The earbuds are very good with base but due to good base lacks some treble but overall it sounds very good.

Other than that addition of type c makes it more convenient to use.
Comes with a charging cable and some eartips.

1. Volume cannot be changed through its touch buttons and
2. There is no indicator light on any earbud.
But sound is good and realme link app works fine with it.",5

"A very decent product i must say, if you are a tech lover & is looking forward for a decent product comprising of all the features prevailing in current tws's then defenitly it will satisfy you more than anything. Call clarity is good.
If you are a hardcore music lover who's lookn for high bass & crisp instrumentals than it will disappoint you as the sound here is rich & balanced in every possible way.",
"Reasons to buy -

1) Premium Build quality

2) Samsung eco system and better compatibility with samsung smartphones.

3) If you value Samsung branding.

4) It's very light weight and comfortable and I didn't find any issues with fitting.

Reasons to avoid -

1) Better than average sound quality => in my opinion Airpods 2 are better in terms of sound signature and I would prefer Airpods only for sound signature but samsung has PNC due to it's design language and ANC too so the sound may feel ...

"Exceptional for Samsung users. Very good for other android users.

The pairing and other ecosystem benefits are amazing. Sound is absolutely perfect. And the best part is, If you don't like the sound, Samsung has an EQ adjustment available in settings.

Charge stays for 6-7 hours at medium to high volume. Case is very portable and well shaped. ANC is not that good compared to AirPods Pro, but this is 3x cheaper. Ambient mode is also same story. Touch controls are good. But sometimes too sen...

Pros:-
1) Good noise cancellation , it does have a snug fit to the ear so it stays in place(need to put ear-tips that fit your ear).

I bought this for vero competitive price..
The earbuds are very good with base but due to good base lacks some treble but overall it sounds very good.
The design of earbuds are very comfortable and fits in perfectly. These are not normal bulging TWS..but looks very good on ears (premium).
Other than that addition of type c makes it more convenient to use.
Comes with a charging cable and some eartips.

"Best AI Gaming earbuds are really good and loaded with features, it supports touch control, play/pause, music mode, gaming mode, noise cancellation to provide best call quality and many others. Playback time of more than 48 hours once the case is charged fully. It also pauses the music when removed from the ear, and starts playing it when plugged back into the ear, this in-ear detection mode is really awesome and handy.",
"Really cool earbuds with good sound quality. I really enjoyed using them, specially their touch sensor are really good. Very easy and comfortable to use. One of the best products in this range. The added perk is the case with glowing lights.",

All modes works well and the call quality is well balanced that the other person will be able to hear you as a person not like a robot. Recommended for those who are looking a budget TWS with good sound quality.,

As I'm audiophile
I tried best TWS in market
compared
Realme Q buds , redmi bud s
And even with realme neo buds.
All them then lacking that extra vocal effect to feel music
Boult truebuds provide it efficiently
Connectivity is mindblowing
Yes i agree with low bass
But it's adequate enough
Not that thumpy bass
And for better quality i use wavelet application along with it


Sum up in a line: Just go for it
If you are audiophile",

Battery is good and can be last around 24 hours depending on sound volume.

Calling sound quality is good but sometimes the person who is another side says that voice is very low or feels like getting sound from far.

Design is almost good but Not very comfortable for small size ear.

Latency is negligible and the microphone is also fine. The control buttons come handy for various controls. The best thing is, it only takes an hour for charging but lasts for more than 20 hours.

If you are okay with silicone buds then go for Bassheadset 103. Its audio quality is better than Basshead 104. I also have 103 model with me.

Do not expect lot of bass in these two models, bass effect is very little. If you are not a bass lover, model 103 would suit you well.",

Callers on the other side reported clear microphone sound with low background noise.

As an overall package, the seamless connection, ease of use and comfortable fit make these a great buy!",

As I'm audiophile
I tried best TWS in market
compared
Realme Q buds , redmi bud s
And even with realme neo buds.
All them then lacking that extra vocal effect to feel music
Boult truebuds provide it efficiently
Connectivity is mindblowing
Yes i agree with low bass
But it's adequate enough
Not that thumpy bass
And for better quality i use wavelet application along with it


Sum up in a line: Just go for it

If you are okay with silicone buds then go for Bassheadset 103. Its audio quality is better than Basshead 104. I also have 103 model with me.

Do not expect lot of bass in these two models, bass effect is very little. If you are not a bass lover, model 103 would suit you well.",

the auto turn off when magnet sticks is very handy and saves battery
audio quality good...balances between the highs and the lows good mids also

i have used skullcandy inkd as well as boat rockerz 225
as a comparison, skullcandy handles every frequencies without any distortion, gives a great quality and feel to the audio
boat adds bass to the normal audio which makes it distorted at large volumes and long usage times
coming to realme, it is far beyond boat in terms of audio...

The earbuds are very good with base but due to good base lacks some treble but overall it sounds very good.

Problems I'm facing

1. Buds don't charge while you charge ur case.
This means once u charge ur case, u have to again leave ur buds and case for the buds to get charged.

2. No charging indicator for the case.

3. Bass boost and dynamic modes in the realme link app are not good.

Apart from those above, the sound quality, design, battery backup, passive noise cancellation, fitting are excellent and very very much appreciated at this price.

Battery backup is great n charges very fast.
Case has matte finish n easy to carry.

ANC is good enough at this price.
Sound is great but not the bass.

One of the best earbud in this price range. I love the design of bud and case also. Better fit even in my weird ear. Audio quality and connection speed is amazing. Bass is really good. Batery backup is good with more than 2.30 hrs in single earbud. Only thing that could have been better is mic quality and sensitivity. Even with noise cancelling mic quality is not enough.,

"Why you go to heavy brands and expensive product where an ultimate champion is here. Just go for it blindly. I am a musicphile guy and always search for good earphones and here my search ends.

"I'm a professional musician since the last 14 years and you can trust me when i say that this is one of the best budget earphones when you talk about the ones with microphone. Sony is always good when it comes to sound quality. The highs the lows everything is nice. Unless you wanna spend a huge sum on professional earphones, then go for this one. Its ergonomic too. And the microphone is also of good quality.",
"Awesome Sound quality...clear voice...I use it with K8 note Dolby Atmos technology and get a excellent output.Bass is also good but it can be a quite loud more...mic is also good in this price range but wire quality is not so good....overall its a great deal for music lover...I use many earphone Jbl c100,Skull candy,Akg,Samsung,Apple,nokia,Philips and others brand but I feel more the clear sound and a Sweet bass from it.(Its connector is not Gold plated,its silver plated)",
I bought this headset for 1 month and 7 days. For the last 1 month it worked perfectly fine.. But for the last 7days problems started. At first the right side sound got quieter day by day and yesterday it stopped working completely. So guys it's upto u to decide whether you want to buy it or not..,

First impression - Awesome.
- Sound quality is quite soothing. Balanced and default works best.

- Battery backup is excellent. Comes 80%
- Design require no comment and Quality is good.
- Feel is awesome. It is quite light weight and does not feel plugged but still fits.


This is my 3rd wireless and my laptop with windows still a challenge to mic.

"I would like to give it a 3 star. The things which could have been better are - Battery Backup & Bass. After full charge, it hardly stays for about 3-4 hrs (which I think is less) & also the sound quality is not very impressive. You'll have to turn up ur volume to max for a mediocre volume.
Overall it's an average product. Thank You!",5

It was nice produt. I like it's design a lot. It's easy to carry. And. Looked stylish.,
I think it is such a good product not only as per the quality but also the design is quite good . I m using this product from January ... In this pandamic situation it has became the most useful and helpful . Overall the bass and the sound quality is pretty good and another thing that will give you such a sigh of relief that it will provide a wire that will help you in case of lacking charges.,

"PROS: best in budget, with a good bass
most loved thing is ?? backup. 1hour charge gives minimum 10 ???? enjoyment
Magnetic attaching helps more to improve battery life more??
CONS: (1)sec ..delay in sounds in pubg?? the only disappointment in these, I bought this for pubg streaming but they bit late in sounds
I don't recommend these for pubg player and for gaming it's not worth

What I liked-

"First of all no battery its wired but thats okay ; sound is somewhat decent ; used for playing csgo and valorant footsteps aren’t exactly crisp but at this price point thats all u can get ! The comfort is not good for my ears atleast pains after 15 mins of usage . The build is sturdy wont break cable is long and overhead cushion is soft .
BUY ONLY IF THE BUDGET IS LOW
Flipkart did their job of delivering it right on time !",

Best gaming tws ever!!! 7rgb lighting case looks super cool. The tws is full of specs at such an affordable price. 40ms low latency works soo good. Dual mode works perfectly.,
"Best in class, look wise it's one of the best the rgb colors is awesome. Made quality is good. Sound is very clear and perfect. No too much of bass, calling performance and al noise cancellation is great .

"I'm a professional musician since the last 14 years and you can trust me when i say that this is one of the best budget earphones when you talk about the ones with microphone. Sony is always good when it comes to sound quality. The highs the lows everything is nice. Unless you wanna spend a huge sum on professional earphones, then go for this one. Its ergonomic too. And the microphone is also of good quality.",5
"Awesome Sound quality...clear voice...I use it with K8 note Dolby Atmos technology and get a excellent output.Bass is also good but it can be a quite loud more...mic is also good in this price range but wire quality is not so good....overall its a great deal for music lover...I use many earphone Jbl c100,Skull candy,Akg,Samsung,Apple,nokia,Philips and others brand but I feel more the clear sound and a Sweet bass from it.(Its connector is not Gold plated,its silver plated)",5
I bought this headset for 1 month and 7 days. For the last 1 month it worked perfectly fine.. But for the last 7days problems started. At first the right side sound got quieter day by day and yesterday it stopped working completely. So guys it's upto u to decide whether you want to buy it or not..,5

1) sound quality is great as expected.

3) battery backup is nice.

Cons :

"I got this in the Big billion days at a very Cheap rate so I find it to be valuable for money.
Secondly the sound quality is amazing, but it could have been more loud and smooth at high volume.
By smooth, I mean the sound to be more clearer(the lows).
The ANC and the beast mode work quite well, specially the ANC which is better or may be comparable to the Nirvanaa.",

Well I've searched a lot of TWS and finally got this in my budget. The sound quality as usual boat is known for its punchy bass and I got the same with these Airdopes moreover the ANC at this price point is good. Your also get two extra modes i.e. Ambient mode and normal mode. All modes works well and the call quality is well balanced that the other person will be able to hear you as a person not like a robot. Recommended for those who are looking a budget TWS with good sound quality.,
This is one the best purchased earphone.. I have been using Sony bass earphone but this newly launched earpods from boat is at par and none less in any parameters. Really happy with this set from boat and beyond my expectations. Must buy guys so affordable and bass sound quality all amazing ??,

However, the call quality is exceptionally good ! Receiving end person doesn't get any unwanted sound occurring around you. ENC works perfectly. You wouldn't find such a neckband than can handle ENC like this one.

"Review after using 10days
The music quality is upto the mark and bass heavy.
My priorities before purchasing -
Comfort for wearing for long hours, dual pairing, music quality and less sound leakage:

Comfort - 6/10
I cannot say it is uncomfortable, but still you can’t wear them for long hours. The ear cup size is same as your ear size (not large) - it applies pressure or either top / bottom of your ear. The cushioning is provided on head band and ear area feels to be premium and provides good...

The headphones offers premium quality sound at affordable price.Bass is simply top notch and ENX technology works perfectly making clear calls .Best buy in this price range.I strongly recommend.,
"Good battery backup.
Still there is a very very small lag while playing games. but really better while comparing with other Bluetooth gaming headsets.
Quality is good, comfortable.
Overall its a good product.
But I will suggest you to wait a little more. Since this is a newly launched product. It's always better to wait and know more about the product than blind investing.",

Worth the money. Good quality and looks pretty handsome too. A little bit more sound and this would be the bestest. Since im used to very high volume i feel a bit uncomfortable at the lack of the sound i approve. But this is totally healthy 4 ur ears tho. Go for it. Trust me its worth it.,5
"I would like to give it a 3 star. The things which could have been better are - Battery Backup & Bass. After full charge, it hardly stays for about 3-4 hrs (which I think is less) & also the sound quality is not very impressive. You'll have to turn up ur volume to max for a mediocre volume.
Overall it's an average product. Thank You!",5

I bought this for vero competitive price..
The earbuds are very good with base but due to good base lacks some treble but overall it sounds very good.
The design of earbuds are very comfortable and fits in perfectly. These are not normal bulging TWS..but looks very good on ears (premium).
Other than that addition of type c makes it more convenient to use.
Comes with a charging cable and some eartips.

Great TV, at a great price, the picture quality is amazing.

"The Frame- as the name suggests is more for as a decor than being a TV. You can get a better configuration TV at a cheaper price but this one has an edge due to its aesthetics.
In standby mode the image gallery gives a look as if an art piece is hanging on a wall. The wallpaper can be put in a slideshow and it keeps on changing.
One Connect is another feature which makes this TV almost wire free. Due to its zero space stand the Frame almost attaches to the wall without any gap.",

Great TV, at a great price, the picture quality is amazing.

"The Frame- as the name suggests is more for as a decor than being a TV. You can get a better configuration TV at a cheaper price but this one has an edge due to its aesthetics.
In standby mode the image gallery gives a look as if an art piece is hanging on a wall. The wallpaper can be put in a slideshow and it keeps on changing.
One Connect is another feature which makes this TV almost wire free. Due to its zero space stand the Frame almost attaches to the wall without any gap.",

Excellent phone for the performance and 5g capabilities and an excellent display with 120hz smooth display. Only drawback which could be a deal breaker for many the camera is probably the worst in the segment. Even with sufficient light not the best photos are achieved. Seems more related to the camera processing itself maybe future updates could improve the performance but till then if camera is a priority. Kindly look away,

"Extremely Big phone with average build quality. Does not have the classy feeling that Note 7S I had earlier. Plastic back. Worst Selfie Camera within recent years from Xiaomi. Decent Back Camera which can give good pictures with minor tweaks in settings.

Xiaomi has went completely down with the software of thia one as they had replaced their Contacts with Google one which has no proper Auto Call Record option without letting other party knowing. Useless.

Camera is by far the best among all other phones. Wide angle lens is quite accurate with colours and distortion is manageable. Portrait AI is good. HDR gives a sense of false positivity but makes the picture looks better compared to a dslr.
iOS doesn't hang and makes multitasking pretty easy.

Overall I will give 9/10 to this phone. If you want to use it for normal purpose like surfing internet, watching videos then okay.

Camera is the poorest ,plz don't buy if ur a camera lover , they say 50mega pixel ,but it's not worth 15mega pixel.

Dolby Atmos is superb

Android is stable but not so impressive .

"Mobile is works very smooth , battery is also good for whole day heavy use with always work on net , looks premium in hand , smooth interface , no heating problem so far and camera is extremely good for my daily use . Night vision is excellent.",5
"I am in love with this phone. V23 is best. But with a little less budget this is a great buy.

I have purchased two phones. One for my mother-in-law and one for my friend.

Nice looks. Of course inspired from iPhone 12. Black Color is better.

Go for V23 if budget is there otherwise T1.",

"Genuine review after a week usage.

Camera is the poorest ,plz don't buy if ur a camera lover , they say 50mega pixel ,but it's not worth 15mega pixel.

Dolby Atmos is superb

Android is stable but not so impressive .

I tried for return after a 4days usage but there is no option for return .

Except for Low Ringtone the phone fulfills the parameters specified. Realme Support were helpful in suggesting settings to improve Ringtone volume but downloading a ringtone App from Google Play Store I could get the desired improvement. Product is good & easy to handle. I appreciate the AI Camera with adjustable parameters a good addition in a budget phone.,
Overall functions are good camera Quility is quit good and nice this is best camera smartphone in this range so any budy can buy it for hard use,
Phone is just awesome everything is so good . Charger is also very good. Thanking flipkart for your services . It values for money ; camera is superb ; display is also good.,

"It is well balanced mobile with a good display, Battery, Performance, and a decent camera. The camera could have been better. For this price range the rear camera is not upto the mark specially in low light, saturation level is little high. Front camera is very good. About video quality i can say it as just good. Since we don't get 4K video quality support the video quality is downgraded. About Performance and Battery, the battery is really good it will last for 1 day very easily. About perfo...",
Looks wise the best mobile. Display is very good. Dolby atmos gives you not the best but better stereo experience. Camera needs to improved a lot. Comes out of the box with A11 best If comes with A12. UI needs tuning as here and there noticing glitches while operating.,

I'm completely satisfied with the product. It is my first Samsung phone and bought only for talking purpose. I have selected golden colour snd it's looks like the same,
"This is a brilliant choice if you are looking for a basic phone to avoid the distraction from the smartphone.
The heilight of this product is the battery life (I got 10 days battery backup) and Call clarity; things we want to be perfect in a basic phone.
Apart from that we have music player which will help you enjoy your loneliness....
Altogether it was an astonishing purchase for me",

"Fantastic product even though it's just an iterative upgrade to iphone 13 pro. The deep purple looks purple when the light hits the phone a certain way and it's beautiful. Dynamic island is very practical and useful. Hopefully it will get better when 3rd party developers start making use of it.

Flipkart's delivery was quick and hassle free. The order was delivered on the launch date and was packed well.",

I used to own a pixel 3 and its front camera output seems to be better than iphone 13's . But overall the camera is good and it will do the job. ...",

At first impression the phone feels good while being held . Light weight and leather like texture gives good grip. Camera is a bit low on quality I felt at first glimpse,5
On 11.11.22 it was raining non-stop and I appreciate the delivery person even in that rain. There is anger on the e-cart company who asked to do such work even in that heavy rain. Act with the sense that everyone is human here. Everyone is ordering from home all day. We have to protect our health. Once again thanks to delivery brother.,
Mobile phone is very good I bought it in low offer The camera shows very well I know this is a good mobile for those who buy this phone with this low budget Delivery within two days Thank you so much Flipkart,

One of the best options in this price range. Clean and highly optimised UI experience which further leads to better processor performance. The only cons are; average quality camera and 20 watts charging speed.,5

"Great phone in this price range.
Excellent performance and good battery back up. Mediatek dimensity 700 performance works well in day to day normal usage. Android 12 is used in the phone with MiUi 13. My father liked it a lot.

The phone is super
The performance of this phone is so good.
the camera is good ,but it should be improved.
And battery can be used more than 10hours once it charge and fast charging work well.
No lagging, no heating was observed till now.
Just good for it.",
"It is well balanced mobile with a good display, Battery, Performance, and a decent camera. The camera could have been better. For this price range the rear camera is not upto the mark specially in low light, saturation level is little high. Front camera is very good. About video quality i can say it as just good. Since we don't get 4K video quality support the video quality is downgraded. About Performance and Battery, the battery is really good it will last for 1 day very easily. About perfo...",
Looks wise the best mobile. Display is very good. Dolby atmos gives you not the best but better stereo experience. Camera needs to improved a lot. Comes out of the box with A11 best If comes with A12. UI needs tuning as here and there noticing glitches while operating.,

I'm completely satisfied with the product. It is my first Samsung phone and bought only for talking purpose. I have selected golden colour snd it's looks like the same,
"This is a brilliant choice if you are looking for a basic phone to avoid the distraction from the smartphone.
The heilight of this product is the battery life (I got 10 days battery backup) and Call clarity; things we want to be perfect in a basic phone.
Apart from that we have music player which will help you enjoy your loneliness....
Altogether it was an astonishing purchase for me",

"A Midrange phone from OnePlus.
Why I choose this phone is only because of the Brand value.We have more other options like Vivo T1 ,Realme 9,9pro , Oppo ,Motorola.

1-The AMOLED display is not there.But it is not important.
2- Wide angle lens is also not there.

"For a phone that retails at this price point, the Jumbo K9 is a decent buy. After using it for 2 weeks, I thought I should put in words what I think about this Karbonn product.

"This is one of the best phones to get at this price range.

Performance:
At this price, I would say this is one of the best performance phones you would get on the market as Motorola provides stock android so that it doesn’t has any bloatware or any unwanted background running processes. This phone uses a Snapdragon 732G which is one of the best 4g processors under 20k so overall performance is smooth and it can also provide above average gaming performance.

Display:
This phone has a 120hz ...",5

Pros :-
1. Big 6000mAh battery

4. Nice clear camera (I'm not a camera person but I liked both the front and rear cameras and the options which we have in the camera app)

Cons :-
1. For those who haven't used big screens like me, getting used to this screen will take a while.

this is all you get for a tiny budget phone like this one. the sound quality and call quality is quite good on this phone. the best part is the battery back-up on this phone.

I liked the design of phone and it's good that Motorola is working on feedback received and improved camera performance. Phone is working buttery smooth and clean UI of moto is just awesome. This are my initial review of phone which is good. One down side is that moto could have given IP68 rating. Otherwise phone is worth of it's price.,4

I purchased this mobile almost 7 months back and writing review today. After damage of my long life working Nokia 3310 I was looking for change and almost same mobile for long battery backup. Motorola is a good reputed company so I thought I should go for it and fortunately I took right decision and purchased it.

It is still working same and when I charge it fully then minimum 3 days I do not need to charge again and my purpose is solved.

So you can go for it.

"Best smartphone under 25k.
I bought this for 11140 in BBD offer with exchange offer. Review after 1 week uses-
Pro-
1. The camera is superb. Best in range.
2. The design, look and feel is really cool.
3. Vivo had overcome the heating issue in this phone.
4. The on screen fingerprint and face unlock is fast.
5. Great performance with no lag and extended RAM.
6. 66watt fast charging is super fast.
7. Overall I loved this phone.
Cons-
1. No 3.5mm earphone jack.
2. No memory card slot.",
"I purchased this phone as soon as it was launched.

Things I love about this phone is the display, battery backup - easily comes for a day with continuous usage, performance, camera-best pics in day light, sound quality and the look of the phone.

What I did not like is that it is missing audio jack(I knew it before buying but I was so excited about this phone) and images clicked indoors are not good as it seems a bit dark.

Overall it is a wonderful phone! Loved it!!",

Got this phone after 4gb ram A50.performance OK for a phone with 6gb ram. Camera is not good specially front camera. Overpriced phone . Took it coz of good refund of old phone. But the return policy n checks r too messy. Got half the money for old phone considering horrible tests. Overall happy with the phone . But yup spent some extra bucks. Expected better,

Battery: it's awesome, lasts for almost 2.5 days because I am not a heavy user but even if u Play games and you are a heavy user then in that case also it will provide more than 12 hours back-up easily.

Performance: overall performance is excellent, you will find some laging in the starting but when...",4

Good Ram, speed & no glitch or errors, display is good, fast charging 0 to 100 in 30 mins, good and decent battry backup for 5000mha, descent sound for dual speaker, camera is also decent, not more or less, it is decent quality phone which is undervalued for now. I dint get earphone with it so no feed back on for it. Picture is taken by the phone itself.",

"I was not expecting it to be this smooth. As soon as I completed the setup, a new update was available and after that the experience was just amazing.

For the camera just install google camera and then it almost beats Pixel 6a in photo quality.

I had no issues with my unit whatsoever as mentioned by some others earlier.

I am loving the haptic feedback, carrier services and fingerprint scanner on this one. It is just flawless.

After the new update, it is more optimised for day to day tasks...",

"Over all great product but the camera seemed to me bit heavy in saturation, and front camera photos are quite over sharpen for me(do not expect actually colore reproduction). Pressor is sufficient enough for gaming with high settings.Bettery performance is also quite good(you can use whole day).few of my pictures is been edited by using ""snapspeed"" App",5
"Reviewing after 1 week of usage.. Read before buying, hope you would find it useful....
Literally feels pretty smooth (refresh rate of 120 hz has to be set manually). Gaming experience is quite well (COD & 8 ball pool). Camera- outdoor and indoor during day time is very good but it shows a lot of noise on output of nightmode cam, rest of its feature working quite well except that 108mp doesn't really feels that much. Look wise it's too good, but feels heavy even with the provided back cover. ...",5

At first impression the phone feels good while being held . Light weight and leather like texture gives good grip. Camera is a bit low on quality I felt at first glimpse,
On 11.11.22 it was raining non-stop and I appreciate the delivery person even in that rain. There is anger on the e-cart company who asked to do such work even in that heavy rain. Act with the sense that everyone is human here. Everyone is ordering from home all day. We have to protect our health. Once again thanks to delivery brother.,
Mobile phone is very good I bought it in low offer The camera shows very well I know this is a good mobile for those who buy this phone with this low budget Delivery within two days Thank you so much Flipkart,

I'm completely satisfied with the product. It is my first Samsung phone and bought only for talking purpose. I have selected golden colour snd it's looks like the same,
"This is a brilliant choice if you are looking for a basic phone to avoid the distraction from the smartphone.
The heilight of this product is the battery life (I got 10 days battery backup) and Call clarity; things we want to be perfect in a basic phone.
Apart from that we have music player which will help you enjoy your loneliness....
Altogether it was an astonishing purchase for me",

It's slow and hanging for even day to day task. Taking 4-7 seconds for apps to open and over that not at all smooth while using the apps.

And other thing that I want to say is kudos to samsung for making me a part of saving the environment by not giving the charger in the box. Now I have to buy a separate charger for this, which will add more plastic content in the environment.
Great initiative by samsung in this mid range segment, not giving a charger in the box.",

Phone body is plastic but built quality is good.
Battery output is normal, it gives 1.5 day backup at full charge.

I want to begin with the design of this phone. I don't think it's possible to not like the look of this phone. The glass back just looks so premium and so comfy to hold.
The UI has one unnecessary app but otherwise looks so clean and easy to use. 120hz display makes it so smooth and a memorable experience. You'd want to use your phone again and again.

Sound: The stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos gives you rich and loud sound but they are not as loud as Redmi note 10 pro speakers but the sound quality is better.

If you guys want excellent audio and video output then this device is a treat . Can't believe how good is this display. It is of samsung flagship level display and coming to the battery. Even after 4500 it works like 5000 mah. Snapdragon 870 is the main reason behind this. Blindly buy it and just remove unnecessary apps then enjoy the best out of it.,

And other thing that I want to say is kudos to samsung for making me a part of saving the environment by not giving the charger in the box. Now I have to buy a separate charger for this, which will add more plastic content in the environment.

"I bought this for my mom who was going to try touch screen phone for tge first time so i went with the lower budget one.
The phone specs might look good on paper, but in day to day usage it's kind of disappointing.
No use of using Android go version because even the go version the phone is still laggy at times.
The basic launcher present does not even have widgets.
That being said the phone is still usable and the free ram stands around 2.5gb out of 4gb while sometimes it goes down till 1gb...",5

"Such a awesome handset in this segment.
Pro's:- * Good display in this price segment but not compete with amoled display.
* Helio G95 performs pretty well ,with 90 hz refresh rate runs smoothly.
* 48 Mp rear sensor satisfies in this price segment, etc

Con's :- * After 1 hour of gaming I found touch issues and some lags ,hope realme fix it in update
* There is no IP rate certification I think so.
* There are lot of heating issues , etc",5
"ALthough the product has some drawbacks, it is the best in this price range with a fairly good camera. One of the main cons I feel about this is it get delayed at times eventhough it has a 6gb ram. but still it has great power efficiency and is fair enough to be called fast charge. i love this product.",5

1. Camera : useless during these days. Quality is extremely low.
2. Charging Port is not durable. If you buy this device, be very careful.
3. Battery quality is extremely bad. It wont last 24hrs even after fully charged.
4. Torch light feature is useless due to dim light.

Here are some merits

1. Its cheap and affordable. Its a 2G phone.
2. It is useful for doing simple task like sending out an SMS and phone calling.

Go for Realme 8...that is better than this Note 10 lite.

I ordered this phone for my father.
My mother is using Realme 8
Realme 8 is not good in terms of camera.
But Battery life, performance, touch experience is better in Realme 8.

When I compared both the phones for performance, I found Realme 8 too much better.
I am Sad because Now I have this Note 10 lite.
Go for Realme 8 without a doubt.",

Very beautiful phone impressive battery 6000 mah good display type c port this product is worth buying go for it ??,
"I have used it for a day, so here are my first impressions:

1. The screen is of good quality, even though its not amoled, the colours are good. so there are no compromises in terms of display.
2. In my brief usage, the battery is good enough.
3. Cameras are good for this price.
4. Stock android, one of the major reasons for buying it. Also the moto app is good enough for customization.
5. Speakers are loud enough.

6. Weight distribution is done really well but my fingers started to pain aft...",
"Pros:
1. All of above, a big 120Hz display with HDR 10 support & true colors (at this price)
2. One & half days battery life at moderate use
3. Latest processor
4. Decent camera spec. w/ RAW (.dng) support both back cameras
5. Near stock UI w/o ads
6. Inbuild a Hardware+Software based security system / ThinkShield Mobile
7. Speaker is louder
8. Finger print reader is fast as usual
9. W/ mighty headphone jack
10. All-over build quality is good enough, still you need a case & screen protector...",

1. Camera : useless during these days. Quality is extremely low.
2. Charging Port is not durable. If you buy this device, be very careful.
3. Battery quality is extremely bad. It wont last 24hrs even after fully charged.
4. Torch light feature is useless due to dim light.

Here are some merits

1. Its cheap and affordable. Its a 2G phone.
2. It is useful for doing simple task like sending out an SMS and phone calling.

"It might not have the wow factor of the Galaxy S22 Ultra, but don't make the mistake of overlooking the Galaxy S22 Plus.

Not good for old people who have difficulty in seeing keypad labels. The keys are not bulged and color not different from panel. So difficult to dial numbers. Bought for mom but she didn't like it. FM radio doesn't work. With voice assist ON keypad response is slow. Display not very clear. Maybe good for other age groups. Some 5 star reviews given based on cashback offer from seller. Value for money if user is young.,5

As this phone is game centric, but doesn't mean one should play games only. Generic user can use that power to finish daily tasks quicker + 800 series survive longer than mid segment SoC's due to premium cores and materials used. Cameras are good not that bad but don't expect much. Attached some pictures before complete switch.

I have switched from Poco F1 to X3 Pro. So, similar balance with good upgrades.

Good Ram, speed & no glitch or errors, display is good, fast charging 0 to 100 in 30 mins, good and decent battry backup for 5000mha, descent sound for dual speaker, camera is also decent, not more or less, it is decent quality phone which is undervalued for now. I dint get earphone with it so no feed back on for it. Picture is taken by the phone itself.",

After using 1week i have done my best review
1) camera worth what u paid but not 64MP
2) while using mobile especially watching videos and slightly heating problem
